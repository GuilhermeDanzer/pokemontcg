This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, run the install command:

```bash
npm install
```
Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## End to End (e2e) 
To run the end-to-end (e2e) tests, follow these steps:

Ensure that your Next.js project is running locally at localhost:3000.
Once your project is running locally, open another terminal window.

In the new terminal window, run the e2e tests using the command:
```bash
npm run e2e
```
